How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

-it can help you find bugs in your code much more easily
-it can help you spot small changes in code 
-it can help you access previous versions of the code, allowing you to see progress

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

-it can help you commit at the right times, instead of at regular intervals that may or may not be in tune with the pace of your work or progress
- it can help you bundle any changes to your code into one commit
-it can be useful to break down tasks into multiple commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-perhaps because some are interdependent while others are not

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-you can use the commit ID to see which lines were added of subtracted
-you can each commit, what time it was made, and by whom

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

-it can allow you to see which changes could be causing the bugs
-it lets you see which of multiple versions of the same code is the reason for the bug
